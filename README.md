# odin-recipes
This is my first project from The Odin Project Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML structure and linking between pages.

🔥 Project Overview
The website contains a main index page with links to a few recipes.
Each recipe page includes:
a title,
an image of the dish,
a list of ingredients,
and step-by-step instructions.

🧠 Skills Practiced
Basic HTML boilerplate
Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
Using relative paths for images and pages
Organizing files into folders
