# odin-recipes
<h2>This is my first project from The Odin Project Foundations course.</h2> 

The goal of this project is to practice basic HTML structure and linking between pages.

🔥 <h3>Project Overview</h3> <br> 
The website contains a main index page with links to a few recipes. <br>
Each recipe page includes: <br>
a title, <br>
an image of the dish, <br>
a list of ingredients, <br>
and step-by-step instructions. <br>

🧠 <h3>Skills Practiced</h3> <br>
Basic HTML boilerplate <br>
Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links <br>
Using relative paths for images and pages <br>
Organizing files into folders <br>
