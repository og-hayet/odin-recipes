# Recipes Project

### This is my first project from [The Odin Project Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).  
The goal of this project is to practice basic **HTML structure** and **linking between pages**.

## 🔥 Project Overview
The website contains a main index page with links to a few recipes.  
Each recipe page includes:
- a title,
- an image of the dish,
- a list of ingredients,
- and step-by-step instructions.

## 🧠 Skills Practiced
- Basic HTML boilerplate
- Headings, paragraphs, lists, and links
- Using relative paths for images and pages
- Organizing files into folders
